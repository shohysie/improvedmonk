  Enjoy the pleasure of becoming a Balthazar with his powerful abilities. 

  The old version is made by mirado (see README-Old.txt). I obtained his consent to create v1.1 in 2008, and now a new version for EE games. 

  The new version is compatible with any modifications made by other MODs and only needs to be installed after them.

COMPONENT 1
  Improve monk with Balthazar' abilities. There're 3 modes to be chosen: Only improves the base class monk with no kit/ Improves all monk kits, including installed monk kit MODs/ Work as a new kit, the Honed Monk.

COMPONENT 2
  Armed monk. Allows monks to use two-handed light weapons (staves and spears) and can invest one more slot to Weapon Proficiences and Weapon Styles (two more slots for Two-Weapons Style). But with disadvantage that the attack animations are not in tune (I don't know how to fix animations).
  It is highly recommended to install my MOD "Weapon Style Rebalance Rebalance" as a cooperation, which allows monks to use tripping skill while holding a single weapon, and to cast more powerful tripping with bare hands.

COMPONENT 3
  Allows all bare-handed skills (e.g. Stunning Blow and Quivering Palm) of monks to be effective also on melee weapons. Supports monk kit MODs installed already.




Details of Improve monk with Balthazar' abilities:

1. At level 1 monk gains "Second wind".

Second wind allows the monk to cure all the wounds and diseases.


2. At level 4, 7 and 10 monk gains "Glitterdust".


3. At level 7, 16 and 25 monk gains "Greater Malison"


4. At level 10 and 15 monk gains "Shadow Stance"

Shadow Stance is similar to the invisibility spell, but the monk is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -6 penalties to the attack rolls. The ability lasts for 5 rounds.

Note: after making an attack the monk is no longer completely invisible.  Opponents can target the monk.


5. At level 15 and 21 monk gains "Faster Than the Eye"

Faster Than the Eye allows the monk to move without being sought.


6. At level 11 and 16 monk gains "Shadowless Kick"

Shadowless Kick allows the monk to strike a mighty blow with 4D8 crushing damage, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 4 seconds.


7. At 3M Exp monk gains new TOB Ability as "Solar Stance"、"Lunar Stance"、"Dragon Fist"、"Tiger Strike"、"Hand of Murder" and  "Resist Project".


"Solar Stance"
Solar Stance causes a fireball from caster. In addition to the enormous 12D6 fire damage as well as 1D8 additional crushing damage, The victim can save vs. spell to take half fire damage. the force of Solar Stance sending out a powerful shockwave that knocks away all foes in the area of effect, Those knocked down will be Unconscious for 2 seconds.
This ability will not harm party members.

"Lunar Stance"
With a superhuman effort, the monk avoid almost certain death. The effect lasts for 4 rounds and during this time the monk's save vs. death receives a bonus of 5, luck is increased by 2 and the monk becomes immune to death magic and time stop for the duration of the ability.
Requires: Solar Stance

"Dragon Fist"
Dragon Fist allows the monk to dispel the protection of any creature in attack. it is 75% likely that Dragon Fist will dispels all of the specific and spell protections of up to 8th level. The target's magic resistance, if he has any, does not affect this spell. Next Dragon Fist will slow the creature for 2 rounds. There is no saving throw versus this ability.

"Tiger Strike"
Tiger Strike allows the monk to gain the ability to strike a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 1 round. All attacks roll made in the next rounds is increased by 10. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.
Large creatures such as a dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.

"Hand of Murder"
With Hand of Murder ability, every attack roll made in the next round is a natural 20, a critical hit. When struck with a Hand of Murder, the victim is complete and unless he saves vs. spell, death occur.

"Resist Project"
Resist Project allows the monk to temporarily tap a great inner strength and fight off the effects of physical and element damage with sacrificing magic resist. For 2 rounds the monk's physical resistance is set to 90%, element resistance is set to 50%, and element damage resistance is set to 10%, but magic and magic damage resist are reducing by 80%. Under the influence of this ability the monk becomes immune to Backstab.

  Enjoy the pleasure of becoming a Balthazar with his powerful abilities. 

  The old version is made by mirado (see README-Old.txt). I obtained his consent to create v1.1 in 2008, and now a new version for EE games. 

  The new version is compatible with any modifications made by other MODs and only needs to be installed after them.

COMPONENT 1
  Improve monk with Balthazar' abilities. There're 3 modes to be chosen: Only improves the base class monk with no kit/ Improves all monk kits, including installed monk kit MODs/ Work as a new kit, the Honed Monk.

COMPONENT 2
  Staff monk. Allows monks to use two-handed light weapons (staves and spears) and can invest one more slot to Weapon Proficiences and Weapon Styles (two more slots for Two-Weapons Style). But with disadvantage that the attack animations are not in tune (I don't know how to fix animations).
  It is highly recommended to install my MOD "Weapon Style Rebalance Rebalance" as a cooperation, which allows monks to use tripping skill while holding a single weapon, and to cast more powerful tripping with bare hands.




Details of Improve monk with Balthazar' abilities:

1. At level 1 monk gains "Second wind".

Second wind allows the monk to cure all the wounds and diseases.


2. At level 4, 7 and 10 monk gains "Glitterdust".


3. At level 7, 16 and 25 monk gains "Greater Malison"


4. At level 10 and 15 monk gains "Shadow Stance"

Shadow Stance is similar to the invisibility spell, but the monk is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -6 penalties to the attack rolls. The ability lasts for 5 rounds.

Note: after making an attack the monk is no longer completely invisible.  Opponents can target the monk.


5. At level 15 and 21 monk gains "Faster Than the Eye"

Faster Than the Eye allows the monk to move without being sought.


6. At level 11 and 16 monk gains "Shadowless Kick"

Shadowless Kick allows the monk to strike a mighty blow with 4D8 crushing damage, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 4 seconds.


7. At 3M Exp monk gains new TOB Ability as "Solar Stance"、"Lunar Stance"、"Dragon Fist"、"Tiger Strike"、"Hand of Murder" and  "Resist Project".

"Dragon Fist"
Dragon Fist allows the monk to dispel the protection of any creature in attack. it is 75% likely that Dragon Fist will dispels all of the specific and spell protections of up to 8th level. The target's magic resistance, if he has any, does not affect this spell. Next Dragon Fist will slow the creature for 2 rounds. There is no saving throw versus this ability.
